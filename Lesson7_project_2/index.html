            <p>
         Search engine indexing is how search engines such as Google and Bing collect data for their services. It uses a process of analyzing phrases and stores that data for later use.The search engine index is where all of that data is stored. The index is what gives the results that are searched for and provides the needed information accordingly. Without the search engine index, search engines would take a much longer amount of time to find what a person is looking for. 
      </p>
      <p>
          There are a lot of different components that come together to emulate a functioning search engine index. One of the most important things are the design factors. Design factors are what makes the index work by outlining the process in which the index runs. Other parts that come together to make a search engine run smoothly are merge factors, index size, storage techniques, fault tolerance, and maintenance.

          <q>At a basic level, there are three key processes in delivering search results.</q> These processes are Crawling, Indexing, and Ranking. Crawling is how the search engine gathers information that has been updated on the internet like new websites or changes to already made websites. After a search engine does its crawling, it starts indexing. Which is when it takes everything that it recorded and puts it all in a database where it is stored for later use. Ranking is basically how search engines provide the closest match to the keywords entered. 
      </p> <p>
          Google is the most popular search engine. Not all indexes are the same but they do have similar basic components. Google uses a search engine spider called Googlebot which does the crawling all over the internet and stores the information on to Google's database. All of the information is stored alphabetically. <img src="images/system.png" alt="Web Crawler diagram" style="float: right"> Within the process, Google ignores certain words like "is, and of" to maximize their performance. Another way Google improves their indexing performance is by skipping over punctuations and converting all letters to lowercase.
